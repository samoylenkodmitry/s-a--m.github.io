title: Useful Vim Hotkeys

## Spending 8 Hours a Day on the Keyboard? This Article is for You.
In this article, I will discuss the minimum commands that I use daily.

### What is Vim
Vim is a program, a text file editor. In almost all Linux distributions, `vi` is installed ("vim" - "VI iMproved"). It has several modes: "text input", "editing", "navigation", and "text selection".

### Spoiler - How to Exit vi(m)?
```
:wq - save and exit
:q - exit


```

### Hotkeys
Hotkeys are key combinations. In vi, each separate key can be combined with another, forming a combo of actions. For example, `7dt,` - delete (`d`) 7 times until (`t`) a comma (`,`). They are pressed sequentially, not simultaneously.

### Navigation Mode

To enter navigation mode from any mode - `esc`.

On opening vi, you are greeted by a thick cursor, as if `insert` mode is activated - command mode and text navigation. At the same time, if you use the 10-finger typing method, your fingers automatically lie on the main navigation keys:

```
h,j,k,l - left, right, up, down

```
![hjkl]({{ site.url }}/assets/hjkl.gif)

Combined with `ctrl`:
```
ctrl+u - scroll up a screenful
ctrl+d - scroll down a screenful
```
Word navigation:
```
w - to the beginning of the next word
b - to the beginning of the previous word
```
![wb]({{ site.url }}/assets/wb.gif)

Navigation with search:
```
f+any_character - find, moves the cursor to the first found character in the current line

```
![f0]({{ site.url }}/assets/f0.gif)

### Command Input Field


```
shift+: - opens the command input field

```
In this field, you can, for example, perform a full-text search and replace throughout the document:
```
%s:regex_to_find:replacement_text - search for regex_to_find and replace with replacement_text, the : delimiter can be any character of your choice
```
![vim_rename]({{ site.url }}/assets/vim_rename.gif)


Jump to any line by number:
```
123 - line number, press enter and the cursor moves to line 123

```
![320_317]({{ site.url }}/assets/320_317.gif)

It's convenient when you need to quickly jump to the beginning `shift`+`:`,`1`,`enter` - moves the cursor to the start

### Insert Mode
Enter text input mode with the key:
```
i - insert, enter text input mode
a - after, place the cursor after the current character and enter text input mode
```
Commands with shift:

```
A - put the cursor at the end of the line and enter text input mode

```
![vim_A]({{ site.url }}/assets/vim_A.gif)

### Editing Text
```
d - delete, used in combination with other commands for deletion:

```
```
dd - delete the entire line under the cursor

```
![vim_dd]({{ site.url }}/assets/vim_dd.gif)
```
dw - delete to the end of the word under the cursor

```
![vim_dw]({{ site.url }}/assets/vim_dw.gif)
```
db - delete to the beginning of the word under the cursor

```
![vim_db]({{ site.url }}/assets/vim_db.gif)
```
dt,symbol_to_delete_until - deletes everything until the specified character within the line

```
```
df,symbol_to_delete_until - deletes everything to the character, including the character itself

```
![vim_df]({{ site.url }}/assets/vim_df.gif)
```
x - cuts the current character and places it in memory

```
![vim_x]({{ site.url }}/assets/vim_x.gif)
```
p - paste, inserts what was in memory at the current cursor position or replaces selected text

```
with shift:
```
D - delete to the end of the current line

```
![vim_D]({{ site.url }}/assets/vim_D.gif)
combo:
```
di,bracket symbol { or [ or ( - delete inside the brackets, the cursor must be inside the expression in the brackets

```
![vim_di]({{ site.url }}/assets/vim_di.gif)

### Text Selection
```
v - enter text selection mode

```
![vim_v]({{ site.url }}/assets/vim_v.gif)

After entering selection mode, you can move the cursor to expand the selection area.
With shift:
```
V - enter line-by-line text selection mode

```
![vim_V]({{ site.url }}/assets/vim_V.gif)

C `ctrl`:
```
ctrl+v - enter selection mode with arbitrary cursor movement. The cursor can be moved vertically, and the selected block will be a rectangle where one corner is the start of the selection, and the opposite one is where the cursor will be placed

```
![vim_ctrl_v]({{ site.url }}/assets/vim_ctrl_v.gif)

Commands to modify text can be performed on the selected area.

Selection can be made with combinations:
```
vi,bracket symbol { or [ or ( - v makes a selection, i indicates that the selection should be made inside the brackets

```
