Recording of this talk - [Experiment with Kotlin Mobile Mutliplatform](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/883386268)

* repository https://github.com/samoylenkodmitry/KMMSimple
* threading - on iOS there are no coroutines, you need to invent an adapter
* iOS shared file is too large - 
2MB minimum,

 +9 MB for ktor,

+2MB for Kotlin serialization

Comparison of the final app size for iOS vs Android:

# Pros:

* shared code
* for Android, there is no difference, you can write for multiplatform "just in case"

# Challenges:

* need to maintain the library, both platforms will use it
* cannot break the compatibility of the library
* set up CI/CD
* unit tests
* all iOS developers need to install gradle, java, set up the environment
* problem with the large size of the shared file on iOS
* Android developer will need a Mac


# Predictions:
 * a new type of job on the market - a multiplatform programmer
 * competition among native programmers will be higher, harder to find a job
 * there will be a future simply because it is profitable for business (unless Apple interferes)
